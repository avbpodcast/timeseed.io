# TimeSeed  - A TimeSync Key Generator
A seed generator for Seeds that generate AES-GCM encryption 

A web-based tool to generate 256-bit AES-GCM keys using a shared 50-character seed. The application supports secure seed generation, optional pepper passphrases, and daily/long-term key derivation with a user-friendly interface. It gives people the ability to just use it as an ordinary encryption tool, but also as a means to "sync" passwords with each other over great distances, using a one-time shared secret or a timeseed only. This gives people a versatile tool that doesn't depend on an ID, central server or set of public/private keys. 
You have a timessed (+optional pepper password) , you have the derived passwords (daily/6 months/custom date) and you have the ability to just use your own passwords directly (or randomly generate one)
It's a small learning curve, with an enormous independently operated buidling block as a result.
You can basically encrypt your communication with anyone freely, and according to your security needs.

## Features
- Generate cryptographically secure 50-character seeds with high-entropy method
- Derive 256-bit AES-GCM keys for daily or long-term use.
- Optional pepper passphrase for enhanced security.
- Smooth progress bar animation during seed generation.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- Downloadable HTML file for offline and local use.
- Links to related tools and contact information.


## Installation
No installation is required! The application runs entirely in the browser.
